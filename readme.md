Kay Frontend Software Engineer Coding Exercise
Thank you for your interest in a career at Kay. We would like to proceed to the next
step of our evaluation process. Below we’ve outlined an exercise that we would like you
to complete.
The Exercise
Your goal is to create a simple web application that displays information about various
airlines. This exercise also serves as a sample of the type of tasks you can expect while
working at Kay.
Requirements
Please use the online platform CodeSandbox to share your work:
codesandbox.io
General Requirements
● The application must at least match the provided mock ups. You may feel free to
experiment beyond that, but make sure that all specifications provided are
followed.
● The application must behave as a single page application (do not reload the
document for any of the behavior).
Functionality Requirements
● The page must behave responsively to accommodate smaller window widths so
that the tiles in each row always fit in the window without being cut off. A mock
up is provided showing an example of the grid within a smaller window.
● Each Airline tile should display the airline name and logo. On hover, more
information about the airline should be displayed (Alliance name, phone number,
& website). The Alaska Airlines & Ukraine International Airlines tiles in the mocks
illustrate the expected display on hover.
● The Alliance filter above the tiles should filter the list of Airlines to only show
Airlines matching the enabled filters if any are selected. If none are selected, the
entire list should be shown.
